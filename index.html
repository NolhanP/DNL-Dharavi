                  <h2>Ok great! So that means that everythings is fine then?</h2>
                  <p style="white-space: pre-line;">
                    Don't be mistaken! Even if the tourism grew over last years, I does not mean that everything is perfecly fine in Dharavi. The area is still very poor and the living conditions are not the best. But the people are very welcoming and you will have the opportunity to meet them and learn more about their culture.
                    You have the opportunity to visit the slum and learn more about the history of Dharavi. That is why you must visit the place with respect in mind. Life in Dharavi is not easy.

                    Take your time to meet new people and maybe create new friendships.
